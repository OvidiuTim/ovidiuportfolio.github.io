            </h2>
            <p>
              I'm an IT graduate looking for an entry-level computer science position. I
              am a responsible person, attentive to details, hardworking, a
              good planner with prolific communication. In the last two years, I have
              worked in fields such as fleet management and human resources. But
              now, I would like to return to IT and develop my programming knowledge.
            </p>

            <p>
              I tend to act based on logical
              thinking, and I have prolific communication. From my previous
              experiences I have learned that good communication, a clear common
              goal, and sustainability throughout projects are essential. My
              favorite field is IT but I am a flexible person and I can adapt to
              several fields. Throughout college I was the local vice president
              of the volunteer organization AIESEC, there I had the opportunity
              to learn HR, sales, managing leading an entire organization to be
              as prosperous as possible. All of that while having a positive impact on the community.

			<a >Work experience<br /> </a>
		  </h2>

          <p>
            One of my past jobs was in the support team, for Endava. It was an important
            job because we were supervising transactions for GlobalPay and
            getting in touch with customers or with the programmer's team, in
            case of an emergency. After that, for one year of my life, I lived in Brazil where
            mostly I did freelancer jobs, like web development, and some
            personal projects like owning a restaurant. After Brazil I had a very challenging job, as a fleet manager, 
            I was responsible for over 130 cars, and coordinate a team of 3 people, in Autonom.

			<a >Future plans<br /> </a>
		  </h2>

          <p>
            In the next period, I want to find a job in which I can develop
            personally and professionally. Also, I m looking for a long-term job that can benefit my needs, a place to grow and to learn. I am still at the
            beginning of my professional journey, but as a general plan I want
            to come back to the programming field, right now I m refreshing my memory about python, 
            and I would love to work with it. As well I am very flexible and I learn very fast, so I would not mind any other working with anything different.
