										<h2><a href="#"> 1.Universo Potencial</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="http://universopotencial.com.br/" class="image fit"><img src="images/UP anim.gif" alt="" /></a>
									<p>Universo Potencial was a freelancer job I did while living in Brazil. The purpose of the company was to promote online educational courses. I was part of the team that build the website. The website was developed to showcase their mission, the team, and the online courses available. The page was created using Elementor on WordPress.

										In worldpress I've added CSS special effects for hover, also change and define the containers using HTML for the phone interface.

										<h2><a href="#">2.smart school</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/Jeff anim.gif" alt="" /></a>
									<p>This project was a learning opportunity about web development. It has a simplistic layout mostly done with HTML and CSS, Navbar with a drop-down menu, different reactive tables using JavaScript, and ngx-bootstrap. The tables represented the teachers and students of a hypothetical school. Each student had a name, a phone number, and a subject attributed to them, and each teacher had a subject. All this information was in an SQL server. Using Postman I made and web API so I could change details about each student and teacher. Everything was made offline with a node server. </p>

										<h2><a href="https://github.com/OvidiuTim/Pizza-restaurant">3.PIZZA DE CASA</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/PC img1.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p>While living in Brazil, I owned a Pizza place and desired to create a website to present our menu and take orders from our customers. Unfortunately, this never came to be. The draft of the site was developed with a friendly interface, it has an order button that takes the visitor directly to our Whatsapp. Scrolling down is the restaurant's menu, a slideshow of the pizzas available, and a short about us section with buttons for our social media. Everything was made in CSS, HTML, and JavaScript. </p>

										<h2><a href="#">4.Black jack</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="https://replit.com/@OvidiuTim" class="image fit"><img src="images/CB anim.gif" alt="" /></a>
									<p>In this project, I coded a game of Blackjack in Python. While the interface is trivial, I focused on the functionality. In the code source, it can be seen that I use my knowledge of if statements, for statements, while loop, lists, functions, dictionaries. If you click "view code source" it will take you to my replit account where you can see all my Python projects, such as a functional calculator, a Hangman game, and many others.

									<p>Is a personal project, where I wanted to develop my front-end abilities. So I tried to recreate a website, it was quite the challenge, but I think it looks well. When I start a project I like to try my best and to make it look as good as possible. Made only with HTML CSS and a bit of JS I think is a good-looking page.
										The inspiration was: https://refour.eu/

										</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/login.gif" alt="" /></a>
									<p>Is a login page, very simple, just the front end part, CSS, and HTML, even if most of my projects are front end I would love to learn the back end part. It's something that I do for fun, I like to learn new things and this is what this project was for me.
